# About
Instanews is a news web app the utilizes NYT APIs to quickly keep you updated with the latest news!  Just pick the category you want and watch the most recent top stories fill the screen, then click the story you'd like to read.  Not a fan of news (who can blame you when it's all about Donald Trump these days)?  Check out some film and book reviews instead.  Whether you're looking to keep up to date with news, arts or entertainment (from the perspective of the New York Times), Instanews is the web app for you!

# Learnings
A great adventure into the lands of Javascript, CSS3, json, ajax, jquery, sass, gulp and lint.  Some great and exciting things were learned, there was also javascript.  A weekend was spent analyzing a single piece of javascript code.  "It should work, why doesn't it work!" was a phrase passer-bys could have heard screamed into the void.  After two days of debugging and researching in the interwebs, a decision was made to abandon .filter() in pursuit of a more vanilla solution.  And what a deliciously plain solution it was!

This project would have been hell without gulp.  It is by far my favorite tool that I have learned about in this course so far.
