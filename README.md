INSTANEWS!

A great adventure into the dreary lands of Javascript, CSS3, json, ajax, jquery, sass, gulp and lint.  Some great and exciting things were learned but, unfortunately, there was also javascript.  A weekend was spent analizing a single piece of javascript code.  "It should work, why doesn't it work!" was a phrase passer-bys could have heard screamed into the void.  After two days of debugging and researching in the interwebs, a decision was made to abandone .filter() in pusuit of a more vanilla solution.  And what a deliciously plain solution it was!

This project would have been hell without gulp.  It is by far my favourite tool that I have learned about in this course so far.
